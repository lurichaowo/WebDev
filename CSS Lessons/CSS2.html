    <h1>Belle</h1>
    <p>
        Belle (竜とそばかすの姫, Ryū to Sobakasu no Hime, literally "The Dragon and the Freckled Princess") is a 2021 Japanese
        animated science fantasy film written and directed by Mamoru Hosoda and produced by Studio Chizu. The story is
        inspired by the 1756 French fairy tale Beauty and the Beast by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont, with Hosoda taking
        cues from the 1991 Disney animated movie.[2]
