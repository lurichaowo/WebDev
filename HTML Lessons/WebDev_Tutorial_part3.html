    <h1>Table Demo</h1>
    <!-- tables -->
    <!-- good way to display data in a tabular format -->
    <!-- back in the day, tables were the way to structure website contents -->
    <!-- uses rows and cols -->
    <!-- table sections -->
        <!-- table element <table></table>-->
            <!-- td = single cell in a table that contains data  -->
            <!-- tr = row of table -->
            <!-- th = defines header of a table row -->
                <!-- needs to live inside its own tr -->

            <!-- these three are more semantic -->
            <!-- thead = used to separate header of a table into it's own section -->
            <!-- tbody = used to separate data of table from the header and footer -->
            <!-- tfoot = used to separate section of table into its own footer -->

            <!-- colspan - attribute -->
                <!-- for columns that span multiple rows -->
            <!-- rowspan - attribute -->

    <!-- forms -->
    <!-- shell of container that contains and groups collections of controls  -->
        <!-- ie - inputs, checkboxes, buttons, etc -->
        <!-- password boxes, normal text boxes, search boxes -->
        <!-- also how and where the data would be sent to after the form is submitted -->
            <!-- data to a server -->

    <!-- empty container, like a shipping label for package or container -->
    <form action=""></form>
    <!-- action attribute is WHERE the form data should be sent to -->
    <!-- ie - action=/search/ from reddit will make url be reddit.com/search/?q="silkie" -->
        <!-- data will be sent via http request -->
    <!-- steps
        1. form is filled out and when form is submitted
        2. http request is sent to destination found in action attribute
            2a. the destination is relative to where the user is currently at 
                ie - going to reddit.com/search/
            2b. Sending a request to a reddit endpoint and passing in the data 
                ie - ?q=silkie 
            2c. we can actually do this without the form by directly typing the data into the url
        3. HTTP request has 2 methods: GET and POST -->

    <!-- labels -->
        <!-- are important for accessbility and for ease of use -->
        <!-- provides text but also going to be associated with an input -->
            <!-- helps organize too -->

    <!-- input -->
    <!-- 20+ diff types: password box, text box, checkboxes, date pickers -->
        <!-- specified by type attribute -->
        <!-- doesn't have closing tag -->
        <!-- also has placeholder attribute that shows something in the box before anything is entered -->
        <!-- common input types -->
        <p>
            <label for="username1">Enter a username:</label>
            <input type="text" placeholder="username" id="username">

        <!-- lable is for captions that is associated with an input clarified via "for" in label being the same as "id" in input -->
        <!-- better for screen readers and accessbility -->
        <!-- better than using span or p or a -->

    <!-- buttons -->
    <!-- Commonly found in forms, but not always -->
